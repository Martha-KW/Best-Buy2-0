# Best Buy 2.0 ðŸ›’

This is a Python simulation of a digital store that handles the purchase process for various
product types â€” including inventory management, promotions, and purchase limitations. This 
project was created for educational purpose during studies at masterschool.

## Features

- **Product types:** Regular products, non-stocked products (e.g. digital licenses), and 
- limited products (e.g. shipping fees).
- **Promotions:** Percentage discounts, "Buy 2 â€“ get 1 half price", and "Buy 3 â€“ get 1 free".
- **Cart & Order Process:** Choose products, apply discounts, and complete orders via a simple
CLI menu.
- **Unit Tests:** Thorough test coverage using `pytest` for all core components.

- **Shopping Cart introduced:** Promotions are now also applied when products added in
several CLI operations to the cart.
